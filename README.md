    <strong>Discuss it first. Then let the agents build it.</strong>
</p>

Crewmate sits between you and your coding agents. You explain what you want built. Crewmate turns that into a clear brief, looks through your codebase for the relevant patterns, discuss for the best outcome with you, splits the work into ordered tasks, then hands those tasks to agents that can run several at once without stepping on each other.

`crewmate` is the command-line tool that makes this work. It keeps track of briefs, tasks, file locks, and notes from past work, so the agent guiding your project can spend its time making calls, not doing bookkeeping.

## The problem it solves

A coding agent is good at building things. Point it at a big, vague request, though, and it will start writing code before anyone has agreed on what "done" means.

Before real work can start, something has to pin down what's actually being asked for, look through the existing code for the patterns already in use, break the work into steps that don't collide with each other, and stop two agents from editing the same file at once. Once work is done, whatever got learned along the way needs to stick around for later — not vanish when the conversation ends.

Crewmate takes care of that planning and bookkeeping layer. Frontman, the agent you talk to, stays focused on decisions and coordination and never touches your files directly. Reading the codebase, planning the work, and writing the code happen in separate agents built for exactly those jobs.

## Setting up

You'll need Node.js 20 or newer.

Install the CLI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/errevion/crewmate
cd crewmate
npm install
npm run build
npm link
```

`npm link` puts `crewmate` on your PATH so you can run it from any project.

Then, inside the project you want to work on:

```bash
cd ~/my-project

# For OpenCode:
crewmate init --harness opencode

# For Antigravity IDE / Agent environment:
crewmate init --harness antigravity-ide
```

This sets up the required plugin, rule, workflow, and MCP integration files for your selected harness (under `.opencode/` or `.agents/plugins/crewmate/`).

Crewmate keeps its own state in `.crewmate/crewmate.db` (SQLite) and records file checksums in `.crewmate/manifest.json`. Add `.crewmate/` to your `.gitignore`. It doesn't need to be checked in.

### Updating existing projects (`crewmate update`)

When you update your `crewmate` CLI to a newer version, you can seamlessly update integration files, agent prompts, and plugins in your existing projects:

```bash
cd ~/my-project
crewmate update
```

- **Custom prompt protection:** If you modified agent prompts or plugins, `crewmate update` automatically creates a timestamped backup in `.crewmate/backups/` before applying the latest template updates.
- **Dependency sync:** It updates plugin dependencies in `.opencode/package.json` while preserving your custom dependencies.
- **Dry run:** Preview changes before applying them with `crewmate update --dry-run`.
- **Skip backups:** Pass `--no-backup` if you don't need backup copies of modified files.

## Running a project through it

The typical workflow uses two commands inside OpenCode: `/brief` to plan and structure the work, and `/execute` to build it safely. You can also drive the CLI yourself if you prefer scripting.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    user["You"] --> frontman["Frontman"]
    frontman --> scout["Scout"]
    frontman --> planner["Planner"]
    scout --> facts["What the codebase looks like"]
    planner --> dag["Ordered list of tasks"]
    dag --> exec1["Executor"]
    dag --> exec2["Executor"]
    exec1 --> result1["Finished work + notes"]
    exec2 --> result2["Finished work + notes"]
```

### Agent workflow (`/brief` and `/execute`)

#### 1. Plan with `/brief`

Start by running `/brief` (optionally passing your initial goal, e.g. `/brief Add GitHub OAuth authentication`):

1. **Requirements gathering** — Frontman creates a new brief and asks questions conversationally (one or two at a time) to fill the five required fields (`workType`, `goal`, `scope`, `functionalRequirements`, and `acceptanceCriteria`).
2. **Codebase discovery (Scout)** — Frontman dispatches Scout to inspect your codebase, project structure, existing configs, and dependencies. Scout reports objective workspace facts, which Frontman discusses with you before filling optional brief fields (`technicalStack`, `constraints`, etc.).
3. **Task breakdown (Planner)** — Once the brief is finalized, Frontman automatically dispatches Planner to decompose the brief into a dependency-ordered list of concrete implementation tasks.
4. **Review & persistence** — Frontman presents the proposed task table for your review. Once approved, tasks are saved to SQLite (`crewmate_add_task`). Frontman then prompts you to run `/execute` when ready.

#### 2. Build with `/execute`

When you are ready to begin implementation, run `/execute`:

1. **Dependency resolution** — Frontman inspects the brief's tasks and active file locks, identifying all `pending` tasks whose dependencies are already `completed`.
2. **Parallel dispatch (Executor)** — Frontman dispatches Executor subagents in parallel for independent tasks that touch different files.
3. **Locking & implementation** — Each Executor acquires locks on the files it needs (`crewmate_acquire_lock`), implements the changes, writes tests, logs incremental artifacts (`crewmate_add_artifact` for facts, decisions, and API contracts), updates task status to `completed`, and releases its locks.
4. **Continuous execution** — Frontman continuously unblocks and dispatches downstream tasks across batches without prompting, pausing only if an Executor hits an error or test failure so you can decide how to proceed.
5. **Final summary** — When all tasks finish, Frontman presents a summary of completed work, recorded architectural decisions, and verification instructions.

### CLI workflow (manual)

If you prefer driving the CLI directly:

```bash
crewmate brief init
crewmate brief set workType software
crewmate brief set goal "Add GitHub OAuth authentication"
crewmate brief set scope '{"included":["authentication","oauth flow"],"excluded":["admin panel"]}'
crewmate brief set functionalRequirements '["GitHub OAuth 2.0 login","Token storage","User profile sync"]'
crewmate brief set acceptanceCriteria '["Users can log in via GitHub","Tokens persist securely"]'
crewmate brief complete
```

### Watching the workflow (`crewmate watch`)

While agents are working, `crewmate watch` opens a live terminal dashboard that refreshes automatically:

```bash
crewmate watch
```

The dashboard has four sections:

| Section | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Header** | Brief ID, status (draft/complete), goal text, progress bar, running task count |
| **Task board** | Every task with a status marker — `[✓]` completed, `[→]` running (animated spinner), `[ ]` pending — plus blocking dependencies and ready-to-run indicators |
| **Event feed** | Last 12 lifecycle events with timestamp, actor, type, and message |
| **Activity graph** | Animated visualization of Frontman dispatching work to Scout, Planner, and Executors, with color-coded agent nodes |

#### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `b` | Toggle full brief details overlay (scope, requirements, stack, constraints, etc.) |
| `t` | Open interactive task selector list |
| `Enter` | View full details of the selected task in the task list |
| `↑` / `↓` or `j` / `k` | Navigate task list or scroll open detail overlay |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn` | Fast scroll in detail overlays |
| `Escape` | Close overlay (task detail → task list → dashboard) or exit dashboard |
| `q` / `Ctrl-C` | Exit dashboard |

The dashboard cleanly restores your terminal state upon exit.

#### Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--brief <id>` | latest brief | Monitor a specific brief instead of the most recent one |
| `--interval <ms>` | `500` | Database poll interval in milliseconds |
| `--once` | — | Print a single JSON snapshot to stdout and exit |

#### Non-interactive mode

When stdout is not a TTY, or when you pass `--once`, the dashboard skips the TUI and prints structured JSON:

```bash
crewmate watch --once | jq .snapshot.tasks
```

This is useful for CI checks, scripting, or feeding state into other tools.

#### Rendering

By default the activity graph uses Unicode box-drawing characters. Set the `CREWMATE_GRAPH_RENDERER` environment variable to `ascii` to fall back to plain ASCII, which is useful in terminals without full Unicode support (e.g. Windows CMD without Windows Terminal):

```bash
export CREWMATE_GRAPH_RENDERER=ascii   # Linux/macOS
set CREWMATE_GRAPH_RENDERER=ascii      # Windows
crewmate watch
```

### Recording events (`crewmate event`)

Workflow lifecycle events are emitted by agents during execution and displayed in the `watch` dashboard. You can also record or query them manually:

```bash
crewmate event add \
  --actor executor \
  --type completed \
  --message "OAuth token storage implemented" \
  --task <taskId>

crewmate event list --brief <briefId> --limit 20
```

**Actors:** `frontman`, `scout`, `planner`, `executor`

**Event types:** `dispatched`, `started`, `locked`, `artifact`, `completed`, `error`

Filters (`--brief`, `--task`, `--actor`, `--type`, `--limit`) can be combined.

### Managing Frontman activity (`crewmate activity`)

Frontman's current operational state is tracked separately from events and powers the activity graph in `crewmate watch`:

```bash
crewmate activity set orchestrating --message "Dispatching auth tasks"
crewmate activity get
crewmate activity clear
crewmate activity list --limit 50
```

**Activity types:** `idle`, `questioning`, `awaiting_response`, `analyzing`, `planning`, `orchestrating`, `reviewing`

All activity subcommands accept `--brief <id>` to target a specific brief (defaults to latest).

## The brief

The brief is the one source of truth Frontman and every downstream agent work from. Five fields are required before Crewmate will let you mark it complete:

| Field | Type | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `workType` | enum | `"software"`, `"infrastructure"`, `"data"`, `"documentation"`, `"audit"` |
| `goal` | string | `"Build real-time chat feature"` |
| `scope` | JSON | `{included: ["messaging"], excluded: ["voice"]}` |
| `functionalRequirements` | JSON array | `["user-messages", "read-receipts"]` |
| `acceptanceCriteria` | JSON array | `["Messages persist", "Files < 25MB"]` |

You can also set `technicalStack`, `constraints`, `existingCodebase`, `referenceMaterials`, `qualityStandards`, `dependencies`, `risks`, and `deliverables`. These add context but aren't required.

## Who does what

Each agent gets only the context it needs for its own job, not the full history of the conversation.

| Agent | Job | What it can touch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Frontman** | Runs the show. Delegates work, keeps state up to date | Nothing directly. It never reads or edits code itself. |
| **Scout** | Looks through the codebase and reports back what's actually there | Read-only. Reports facts, doesn't make calls. |
| **Planner** | Turns a completed brief into an ordered list of concrete tasks | The brief and Scout's findings. |
| **Executor** | Does the actual implementation work | Its assigned task, under a file lock. |

## Keeping parallel agents out of each other's way

When more than one Executor is running at the same time, file locks stop them from touching the same files:

```bash
crewmate lock acquire <taskId> --files src/auth/github.ts src/auth/session.ts
crewmate lock list
crewmate lock release <taskId>
```

If a task can't get a lock because another task already holds it, the Executor stops right away instead of guessing and risking a broken merge.

## Carrying knowledge forward

Executors write down what they find as they go, so later tasks don't have to rediscover it:

| Type | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `fact` | Something true about the system right now |
| `decision` | A design or architecture choice that was made |
| `api_contract` | A route signature, interface, or schema |
| `constraint` | A rule later tasks need to respect |
| `note` | A general observation |
| `log` | A record of what happened during execution |

These stick around independent of any conversation, so a task started next week can build on what a task from today already figured out.

## Deciding what runs next

Tasks form a dependency graph rather than a flat list, a DAG, in the usual sense: each task can name other tasks it depends on, and nothing runs before its dependencies finish. Frontman looks for every task that's `pending` with all its dependencies `completed`, then dispatches as many of those in parallel as the file locks will allow.

## Where things live

Everything is stored in SQLite, at `.crewmate/crewmate.db`:

- **briefs** — project definitions, with every field saved as JSON
- **tasks** — linked to a brief, with dependency edges between them
- **artifacts** — the knowledge Executors have written down
- **locks** — which files are currently claimed, and by which task
- **events** — lifecycle events from each agent (dispatched, started, completed, errors)
- **activities** — Frontman's operational state history

This survives between sessions. Point Crewmate at a project that already has a `.crewmate` folder and it picks up right where it left off.

## Connecting to a coding harness

Crewmate talks to AI coding harnesses through an adapter, so the core logic doesn't need to know which harness it's running under. OpenCode is supported today; Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor are reasonable candidates for future adapters. See [src/harness/README.md](src/harness/README.md) for adapter architecture details and instructions on adding new harness adapters.

## Commands

A typical session, watching a brief through to completion:

```bash
BRIEF_ID=$(crewmate brief init | jq -r '.id')
crewmate brief set workType software
crewmate brief set goal "Add GitHub OAuth login"
crewmate brief set scope '{"included":["auth"],"excluded":["admin"]}'
crewmate brief set functionalRequirements '["GitHub OAuth 2.0","Token storage"]'
crewmate brief set acceptanceCriteria '["Users can log in","Tokens persist"]'
crewmate brief complete

# watch the live dashboard in another terminal
crewmate watch --brief $BRIEF_ID

# or pull a snapshot for scripting
crewmate watch --once --brief $BRIEF_ID | jq .snapshot.tasks

# query individual components
crewmate task list --brief $BRIEF_ID
crewmate lock list
crewmate artifact list --brief $BRIEF_ID
crewmate event list --brief $BRIEF_ID --limit 20
crewmate activity list --brief $BRIEF_ID

# if something's stuck
crewmate brief status      # see which required fields are missing
crewmate task remove <id>  # remove a task that's stuck
```

## Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- A project directory, new or existing
